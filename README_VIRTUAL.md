# MRTwin_pulseq - Readme for virtual attendance

MRTwin is a tool to code sequences manually and simulate MR images using the included Bloch simulation. <br>
All materials and readmes how to install can be found here:<br>
https://github.com/mzaiss/MRTwin_pulseq <br>
The script can be found here: <br>
https://github.com/mzaiss/MRTwin_pulseq/tree/mr0-core/script <br>
I recommend to prepare the script beforehand a bit.

It covers A : basic echoes in 1D, B : gradient echo encoding and fast GRE MRI, C : spin echo and RARE, D : balanced SSFP, E : exporting and scanning at a real MRI system, F : non-cartesian trajectories, undersampling and reconstruction.

For installation at home check [README_HOME.md](README_HOME.md).

## Course setup  - next start at Monday 29. Jul 2024 to  9. Aug 2024
The course format is full time two weeks. <br>
We meet  daily from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm (CET).<br>
The first week is very interactive, with small inputs, and interleaved exercises and discussion of them.<br>
The second week is more independent.

Unfortunately, I cannot interact with people joining virtually. But with the script and the available exercises and their solutions, you should be fine.
For questions regarding installations, I try to dedicate someone in zoom to help you out in a breakout session.
